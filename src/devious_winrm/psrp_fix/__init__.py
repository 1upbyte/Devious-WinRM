"""Custom fixes for various pypsrp methods.

Currently, this module fixes the sesion dying when there is no activity
for an extended amount of time. 
Credit to @adityatelange on GitHub for discovering the fix. 
All I did was adapt it to a later version of pypsrp.

This folder is not checked when linting to more closely preserve
the original code format / style.
